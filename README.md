# GPe Dynamics
This repository contains all source code used to obtain the results reported in (add citation). This includes simulation and analysis scripts for a computational model of two coupled inhibitory populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons. The two populations represent the prototypical and arkypallidal cell populations of the globus pallidus pars externa. 

The repository is organized into separate folders, containing scripts in different languages (Python, Matlab, Fortran).
