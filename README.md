This repository contains all source code used to obtain the results reported in (add citation). This includes simulation and analysis scripts for a computational model of two coupled inhibitory populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons. The two populations represent the prototypical and arkypallidal cell populations of the globus pallidus pars externa.
